# OwlExchange-eCommerce-Web-Application-
OwlExchange provides a modular eCommerce platform that supports donation, exchange and resale of household and personal items within college communities. The system, developed using React, JavaScript and MS SQL, is designed as a scalable and extensible web application to support multi-semester enhancements. This project is sponsored by Assurant Global Technology, with the guidance from our mentors Robert Fortunato and Norbert Monfort guiding the student development team, who serve as the developers and maintainers. This project is a web-based application with supporting documents that include the system roadmap, developer guide, and technical document that defines the baseline architecture and future integration pathways.
